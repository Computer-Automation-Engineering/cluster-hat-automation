# cluster-hat-automation
A small pet project for the cluster hat. Several utilities and some instructions are planned. Come check it out!

## But why?
There are a few different interesting articles regarding this but none seem to be updated to include the new Rasipian authentication requirements. Also, I dont think I've seen one that works with h3s so I figure while I tinker I should record.  

## RPI Locator
One of the things I loved was a java based GUI that would search my local network for all raspberri pis and give me the IP addreses. Last I checked that projects is semi abandoned. The first thing I need to do after install is find my IP addresses. This is because just about in all cases I do not want to connect a screen, keyboard, and mouse to my raspberry pi, ever.
